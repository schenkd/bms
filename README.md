# bms
bms means blog-management-system

In search of a content-management-system that met my needs

I don't want to make a compromise.

So I decide to build my own blog-management-system that correspondent with my wishes.


I'm using python/flask for my backend and bootstrap for my frontend layout.

SQLAlchemy will transform your querys in every database language that you want.

I'm using Jinja2 as my python template engine.

It's pretty cool and very easy to use it for generating dynamic content in your html files.
